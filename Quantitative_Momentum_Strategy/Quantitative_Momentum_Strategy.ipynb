    "The code is retrieving historical price data for a list of stock symbols from the Alpha Vantage API and performing calculations on the price returns for different time periods. Let's go through the code step by step:\n",

    "\n",
    "The interval variable is set to \"DAILY\", indicating that the historical price data will be retrieved on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculate_price_return(start_date, end_date) function is defined. It takes two parameters, start_date and end_date, representing the start and end dates for calculating the price return. Inside the function, it retrieves the closing prices for the specified dates from the prices dictionary, calculates the price return, and returns the result as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty list df1 is initialized. This list will store dataframes for each stock symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code enters a loop that iterates over the symbols list in batches of four. This is done to avoid making too many API requests simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the loop, the code makes an API request to retrieve historical price data for each stock symbol using the Alpha Vantage API. The URL for the request is constructed based on the symbol and the API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response from the API request is obtained, and the JSON data is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant price data is extracted from the JSON response and stored in the prices dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code calculates the price returns for different time periods (3 years, 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, and 1 month) by calling the calculate_price_return function with the appropriate start and end dates. If an error occurs during the calculation, the corresponding price return is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current price is extracted from the prices dictionary using the fixed date \"2023-05-12\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A new dataframe df is created to store the symbol, price, number of shares, price returns for different periods, and percentiles. The dataframe is appended to the df1 list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop finishes, the code concatenates all the dataframes in df1 into a single dataframe result_df using the pd.concat() function. The ignore_index=True argument ensures that the concatenated dataframe has a continuous index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a time.sleep(60) statement, which pauses the execution for 60 seconds. This is likely added to avoid overwhelming the API with too many requests in a short period."
